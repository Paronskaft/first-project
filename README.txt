Idea behind the project is to create a program which takes an input (links to job offers) from txt file.
Then it creates csv file which contains all the mandatory and extra skills required for a jobs you are interested in.
Right now it works only for "No Fluff Jobs" job search engine.

I intend to develop this project, so many new features and new search services handling are coming in the future.

QUIC START

You will need BeautifulSoup library for Python. To install it use PIP and the following command:

    pip install beautifulsoup4

1. Prepare a txt file with links to nofluffjobs.com jobs offers. Each link should be in new line.

2. Run the program. If the txt file with links is in the same folder as program just input the file name.
Otherwise you will need to input whole path. For example your/path/links.txt
